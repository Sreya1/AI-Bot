# AI-Bot
An Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Bot for a 4 by 4 board which is further subdivided into 4 by 4 blocks using Artificial Intelligence. It uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to decide its move. Also designed heuristic function to enable it to choose a more optimal move than a lesser optimal one.

Need to call the Player44 class from the team44 file to play against another bot(or random player) in the simulator.
